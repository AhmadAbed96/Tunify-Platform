# Repository Design Pattern

* Overview
The Repository Design Pattern decouples data access logic from the business logic in the application, promoting modularity and testability.

#

* Implementation 
In this project, repositories were created for managing data access for the Users, Playlist, Song, and Artist entities. These repositories encapsulate CRUD operations and any additional data access logic, making the application easier to maintain and extend.
#
Benefits : 
* Separation of Concerns: Keeps data access logic separate from business logic.
* Testability: Allows for mocking data access during unit tests.
* Flexibility: Facilitates changes in data access strategy without affecting business logic.

# New Navigation and Routing Functionalities
In this lab, we have added new routing functionalities to manage the relationships between playlists, songs, and artists in the Tunify platform. These enhancements allow users to interact with the platform through specific API endpoints designed for adding and retrieving songs in relation to playlists and artists.

 Playlist-Song Relationships
* Add a Song to a Playlist:

Endpoint: POST api/playlists/{playlistId}/songs/{songId}
Description: This endpoint allows users to add a specific song to a playlist. The playlistId and songId are passed as route parameters to identify the playlist and the song to be added.

* Retrieve All Songs in a Playlist:

Endpoint: GET api/Songs/GetSongsByPlaylist/2

Description: This endpoint retrieves all the songs associated with a specific playlist. The playlistId is passed as a route parameter to identify the playlist.

  Artist-Song Relationships

* Add a Song to an Artist:

Endpoint: POST /api/Songs/GetAllsongsbyanartist/2
Description: This endpoint allows users to associate a specific song with an artist. The artistId and songId are passed as route parameters to identify the artist and the song to be added.
* Retrieve All Songs by an Artist:

Endpoint: GET api/Songs/artists/1/songs/2
Description: This endpoint retrieves all songs that have been associated with a specific artist. The artistId is passed as a route parameter to identify the artist.

# Swagger UI Integration
# Overview
In this lab, Swagger UI has been integrated to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Tunify API. Swagger UI automatically generates interactive documentation based on the API's structure, allowing you to test and explore API endpoints directly from your browser.

 ccessing Swagger UI
* To access Swagger UI:

Ensure that the application is running by executing the project. You can do this by running the following command in your project directory:

bash

dotnet run
Alternatively, you can start the application from Visual Studio by pressing F5 or Ctrl + F5.

Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to the following URL:


* http://localhost:5062

This will direct you to the Swagger UI interface.

* Using Swagger UI
Explore API Endpoints: The main page of Swagger UI will list all available API endpoints, organized by categories (e.g., Artists, Playlists, Songs). Click on any endpoint to expand and view details such as request parameters, responses, and status codes.

Execute API Calls: You can test any endpoint directly from the Swagger UI. To do this:

Expand the desired endpoint.
Click on the Try it out button.
Fill in any required parameters.
Click on the Execute button to send the request.
The response will be displayed below, showing the status code, response body, and any relevant headers.
View JSON Schema: Each endpoint provides an example request body and response schema in JSON format, which can be useful for understanding the structure of the data being sent and received.

You can install these packages using the NuGet Package Manager or the following commands:

```
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
```
 
 * Configure Identity in Startup.cs:

In the Program.cs, add the following configuration to set up Identity:

```
builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
        options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
builder.Services.AddIdentity<ApplicationUser, IdentityRole>()
.AddEntityFrameworkStores<TunifyDbContext>()
.AddDefaultTokenProviders();

 app.UseAuthentication();
```

* Registration
To register a new user, you can use the following API endpoint:

Endpoint: POST /api/account/register

Request Body:
```
{
  "firstName": "string",
  "lastName": "string",
